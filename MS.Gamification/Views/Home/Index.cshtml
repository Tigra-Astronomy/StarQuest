        <h2>Discover the night sky</h2>
        <p>
            The Star Quest programme is designed to take you through observations of the night sky
            in order of difficulty, starting from simple observations of the Moon all the way through
            observing distant galaxies and nebulae.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will help you work through the Foundation Mission at our public viewing evenings held
            at Thanet Observatory, or you can work on your own if you like.
        </p>
        <h2>Record your observations in your own observing log</h2>
        <p>
            Observations that you submit go into your observing log and form a permanent record of your progress.
            To prevent cheating, observations must be approved by a Moderator so it will help to include plenty
            of notes and an accurate date, time and location. Once an observation is approved, you will score
            points and complete one of the challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can submit more than one observation per challenge. Each approved observation awards points,
            but you can only complete each challenge and obtain each badge once.
        </p>

        <h2>Take on challenges</h2>
        <p>
            Star Quest is structured so that each level has a number of challenges of similar difficulty.
            Within each level, you can choose whichever challenge you want to work on in any order.
        <p>
            The challenges are grouped into themes known as “tracks”. Completing a track awards a badge
            and a title and may unlock another level or even another mission!
        </p>
        <p>
            Completing all challenges in all tracks in a mission awards a special “Legendary” title.
        </p>
        <h2>Keep track of your progress</h2>
        <p>
            As you submit observations and progress through the challenges and missions, you will
            receive email messages notifying you of your achievements. Most often, this will be when
            you score points or earn a badge, but you never know what could happen!
        </p>
        <p>
            You can view charts of your overall progress and other details of your achievements
            on your Profile page.
